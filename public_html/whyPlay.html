	    Whether you play or not as a result of this website, I do not care. But look at how happy these two are! That should be reason enough for you to get out and play. You'll be smiling just like them in no time. Tennis is a fast-paced game of chess - the excitement of outsmarting your opponent is unmatched by any other sport.

	    Millions of players have dedicated hours to this sport, to great results. This is a sport that you can actually feel yourself improve in with practice. The dude on the right is the real deal.

	    Unless you are a ghost like the guy on the left, you can play tennis. It's a sport for a lifetime. Not the guy on the left, though. He's dead.
