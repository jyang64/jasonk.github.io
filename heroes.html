<p>Professional tennis is split into the women&rsquo;s side, or WTA, and the men&rsquo;s side, or ATP. Fans agree that tennis is one of the few sports that is currently living in the age of the GOAT (greatest of all time): Roger Federer, who dominated the game during his peak years, and still is a force to be reckoned with today. <br />Other modern legendary players on the men&rsquo;s side include Rafael Nadal, known for the unbelievable amount of spin that he puts into his forehand, and Novak Djokovic, whose orthodox style makes him consistent without peer.</p>
<p>Modern heroines on the women&rsquo;s side are prevalent as well. Serena Williams is often the favorite in major tournaments, because of her power and intense fighting spirit. Younger players with similar play styles to Serena like Naomi Osaka and Sloane Stephens are eager to take her place.</p>
